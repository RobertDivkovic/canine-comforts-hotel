We are located in the serene surroundings of Vienna's 21st District, Floridsdorf, offering a perfect getaway for your furry friends. Our hotel is designed to cater to the needs of dogs of all breeds and sizes, ensuring they enjoy their stay just as much as you enjoy your time away. Below is an overview of our project's UX design, including the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface planes.
